## Welcome to the unit. 

Hello and welcome back to Semester 2 at Man Met. This email is to welcome you and get you rolling on the Calculus unit. 

My name is Killian O'Brien, a Senior Lecturer in Mathematics here at Man Met, and I will be teaching this unit in both the lectures and tutorials. 

The unit will start in earnest at the lecture on Thursday morning at 9am in JD E322, followed by a tutorial on Friday afternoon. All these sessions are two hours long. Please check your timetables for details of your tutorial session and any updates. 

In the meantime I would ask you to go to the unit's <a href="https://moodle.mmu.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=172028" target="_blank">Moodle page</a> and read the introduction and survey the content there. 

Some activities for you to do in advance of Thursday:

* On Moodle, click through to the textbook <a href="https://killianobrien.github.io/apex/output/html/apex-calculus.html" target="_blank">APEX Calculus</a> and explore the textbook. Note that we will only be directly using a subset of the chapters of this book, namely chapters 1, 2, 3, 4 (partial), 5, 6, 7 (partial) and 9. 
* Look over the schedule table on Moodle for an indication of what topics we'll be covering and when. This table will be updated with links to various resources as we go through the unit.

You will find my contact details near the top of the Moodle page. Click the relevant button to message me on Teams or email me. 

Looking forward to seeing you all on Thursday morning!

Best regards, 

Killian O'Brien<br>
