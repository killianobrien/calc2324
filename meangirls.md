## *Mean Girls*

Friday's tutorial prompted a discussion of the math competition towards the end of the 2004 film [Mean Girls](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377092/), an American High School comedy.

I haven't seen the film, but looked up the relevant scene.

Thankfully, the mathematics in the movie is correct, if poorly type-set (functions names $\sin$, $\ln$, etc should be in normal upright font, not *italics*).

Here's the limit
$$\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\ln(1-x) - \sin(x)}{1- \cos^2(x)}.$$
